## Technical Details

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Detailed pipelines for image resizing, normalization, augmentation, and segmentation ensure robust input data for training and inference.

- **Model Architecture:**  
  The CNN is constructed with multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. Key functions include loss computation and performance evaluation, as seen in methods like `get_roc_curve()` in `util.py`.

- **Performance Metrics:**  
  Utilizes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC (Area Under ROC Curve). ROC curves are produced using `matplotlib` and `sklearn.metrics` to visually assess classifier performance.

- **Interactive Experiments:**  
  The `X-Ray.ipynb` notebook provides step-by-step demonstrations, experimental setups, and diagnostic warnings generated by TensorFlow and Keras, ensuring reproducibility and transparency.

## File Structure

- **readme.md:**  
  Detailed documentation and project overview.

- **util.py:**  
  Contains utility functions including `get_roc_curve(labels, predicted_vals, generator)` which:
  - Computes ROC and AUC for each class.
  - Dynamically generates and displays ROC plots.
  - Handles exceptions for classes with insufficient data.

- **batch_download_zips.py:**  
  Automates the download of the extensive NIH chest X-ray dataset (~40GB).

- **X-Ray.ipynb:**  
  An interactive Jupyter Notebook for model training, evaluation, and visualization.
  - Includes detailed output logs and warnings for deprecated functions.
