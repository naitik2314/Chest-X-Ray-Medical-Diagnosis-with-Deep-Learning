Chest X Ray Medical Diagnosis with Deep Learning

For the dataset, head over to this site which is of nih and the dataset is of over 40GB in size, so I couldn't upload it to GitHub, and as soon as you download all of the dataset and unzip it to the folder in this repository named images-small, in the nih folder.
The link for the dataset: https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC

The other option is that run the batch-0donload-zips.py file, this python script will download all of the deataset, so you don't need to individually download each and every zip file.
Remember that the files will be downloaded to the default location C:\Users\(Username), so make sure you have around 40GB free disk space.
